## Description

Install and configure Kibana5 as easy as include a single module and add all
attributes through hiera.

## Setup

### Beginning with kibana5

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most
basic use of the module.

## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the
fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage
examples and code samples for doing things with your module.

## Reference

Here, include a complete list of your module's classes, types, providers,
facts, along with the parameters for each. Users refer to this section (thus
the name "Reference") to find specific details; most users don't read it per
se.

## Limitations

Currently, only Debian 8 is supported. Contributions are welcome.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.
